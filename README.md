# UCC management

The UCC lives in several repositories within the [UCC23](https://github.com/ucc23) organization
and in its associated [Zenodo repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8250523).

- The [updt_ucc](https://github.com/ucc23/updt_UCC) repository, this one, contains the scripts and data files
  required to update the UCC (mostly) automatically. It also contains the
  main files that make up the UCC: `UCC_cat_B.csv`, `UCC_cat_C.csv`, and the
  `UCC_members.parquet` file with all the identified members  (stored
  in the `zenodo/` folder).

- The [ucc](https://github.com/ucc23/ucc) repository contains for each entry in the database a corresponding
  entry in the form of an `.md` file, in the `_clusters/` folder. This repository
  also contains all the files required to build the [public site](https://ucc.ar)

- The `plots_X` repositories contain several plots per OC in various folders:
  one with the four diagrams, one for Aladin, and plots for the HUNT23 and/or CANTAT20
  members when available. The plots are loaded by the public site from this repository.

- The [arxiv](https://github.com/ucc23/arxiv) repository contains the script and workflow that generate the JSON
  file loaded by the [arXiv](https://ucc.ar/arxiv/) section of the public site.



## 1. Adding a new DB

Given a new database (DB) to be added to the UCC, the  `A_get_new_DB.py` script
manages the updating of the JSON file that contains the information for each database
in the UCC, as well as downloading the Vizier database if available and/or requested:

1. Load the current JSON database file.
2. Check if the URL is already listed in the current database.
3. Fetch publication authors and year from NASA/ADS
4. Generate a new database name based on extracted metadata.
5. Handle temporary database files and check for existing data.
6. Fetch Vizier data or allow manual input for Vizier IDs.
7. Match new database columns with current JSON structure.
8. Update the JSON file and save the database as CSV.

Once the JSON file with the entry for the new DB and the generated CSV file with the
DB data are stored in the temporary folder, **check carefully both files before moving
on** as both might need manual intervention.

**Important**:
1. The column with the names of the new entries can contain several names; these must
   be separated using a ','.
2. The first name in the name(s) column (if there's more than one) will be used as
   the `fname` for that entry

### Input

- `ADS_bibcode`: NASA/ADS bibcode for the new DB
- `data/databases_info.json`: Current JSON file with info about the databases included
  in the UCC

### Output

- `temp_updt/data/databases_info.json`: Updated JSON file with new DB entry
- `temp_updt/data/NEW_DB.csv`: New database in CSV format



## 2. Updating the UCC: first step

The `B_update_UCC` script handles two possible cases:

1. Adding a new database to the UCC
2. Rebuilding the entire UCC

The case is decided by the script according to whether it finds a temporary
`databases_info.json` file with new DBs to add.

The final `UCC_cat_B.csv` file contains the following main columns:


> "fnames","DB","DB_i","Names"


which are the main identifiers for each entry in the UCC. Along with these columns,
the file also contains the following columns which are used only as centers to estimate
membership by the next script:

> "RA_ICRS","DE_ICRS","GLON","GLAT","Plx","pmRA","pmDE"


### Input

- `temp_updt/data/databases_info.json`: New JSON file (generated by script A)
- `temp_updt/data/NEW_DB.json`: New database (generated by script A)
- `data/UCC_cat_B.csv`: Current version of this file
- `data/databases_info.json`: Current JSON database file
- `data/globulars.csv`: Globular clusters data file

### Output

- `UCC_cat_B.csv`: Updated version of this file (old one is archived)
- `temp_updt/UCC_diff_new.csv`: Non-matching entries in the new database
- `temp_updt/UCC_diff_old.csv`: Non-matching entries in the old database

The last two files are meant to be viewed with a diff app (e.g.: Meld) side by side

If new DBs were added then these files are moved from temporary folders to their
final destination:

- `data/databases_info.json`: Updated UCC database JSON file
- `data/NEW_DB.csv`: New database in CSV format


Notice
------

If main fnames are changed in this file, these changes need to be manually
propagated to:

- the `UCC_cat_C.csv` file
- the `UCC_members.parquet` file
- the plot files in the `plots/` folder, and
- the site files in the `ucc/_clusters/` folder

This is done using the `BC_fnames_renaming.py` script.




## 3. Updating the UCC: second step

The `C_process_member_files.py` script generates the `UCC_cat_C.csv` file and updates
the parquet file with all the identified members. It also generates the required files
for uploading to the Zenodo repository. These files need to be manually uploaded to a
new Zenodo release.

The `UCC_cat_C.csv` file contains columns that represent the following information:

```
- fnames: names of each entry (must match those in the B file)
- plots_used: (y/n) tells the D script if an entry plot needs to be generated/updated
- process: (y/n) manual flag that indicates whether to process this entry
- N_clust: Fixed number of cluster members (has precedence over N_clust_max)
- N_clust_max: Maximum number of cluster members
- N_box: Multiplier value for the box size used to search for members
- frame_limit: A string in the format "x_111.1,y_222.2" where "x" and "y" are one of the
characters: 'b' (bottom), 't' (top), 'l' (left), 'r' (right) for (GLON, GLAT)
coordinates; 'pmb' (bottom), 'pmt' (top), 'pml' (left), 'pmr' (right) for (pmra, pmde);
'plxl' (left), 'plxr' (right) for parallax; and the numbers are the limiting values
for each.
```
The rest of the columns are generated using information taken from the estimated members
for each entry:

> "r_50","C1","C2","C3","N_50","GLON_m","GLAT_m","RA_ICRS_m","DE_ICRS_m","Plx_m",
> "e_Plx_m","pmRA_m","e_pmRA_m","pmDE_m","e_pmDE_m","Rv_m","e_Rv_m","N_Rv",
> "shared_members","shared_members_p","C_N","C_dens","C_C3","C_lit","C_dup",
> "C_dup_same_db","UTI"

This script perform the following main operations:

### 3.1. Change detection
Compares two versions of the UCC catalog: a source catalog (`UCC_cat_B.csv`) and the
current catalog (`UCC_cat_C.csv`). It identifies three sets of open clusters:

- New clusters to be added (B entry not in C --> Add to C)
- Old clusters to be removed (C entry not in B --> Remove from C)
- Existing clusters that have been manually marked for reprocessing
 (C entry with 'process=y' --> Reprocess in C)

### 3.2 Cluster processing
For each new or re-processed cluster, the script performs a detailed analysis:

- Uses the `fastMP` method to identify likely member stars
- Saves the list of member stars for each cluster into an individual .parquet file
- Calculates various parameters for the cluster based on its members

### 3.3 Data file updating
After processing all the necessary clusters, the script updates the main UCC data:

- Combines all the individual member .parquet files into a single, updated master
  members file
- Updates the `UCC_cat_C.csv` file with the newly derived data, adding new clusters
  and removing old ones

### 3.4 Post-processing
- Finds Shared Members: analyzes the entire member list to find stars that belong to
  more than one cluster and records this information
- Calculates the UTI


### Input

- `data/df_UCC_B_updt.csv`: Current UCC database (produced by the B script)
- `data/df_UCC_C_updt.csv`: Current version of this file
- `data/databases_info.json`: Current UCC database JSON file
- `Gaia data files`: Gaia data files for a given release
- `databases/globulars.csv`: Globular clusters data file
- `zenodo/README.txt`: README file
- `zenodo/UCC_members.parquet`: File with estimated member for all the clusters

### Output

- `data/df_UCC_C_updt.csv`: Updated version (previous version is archived)

Files uploaded to Zenodo:
- `zenodo/README.txt`: Updated version
- `zenodo/UCC_cat.csv`: A simplified CSV version of the main catalog, formatted for
  public release on Zenodo
- `zenodo/UCC_members.parquet`: Updated (**FILE NOT TRACKED BECAUSE IT IS TOO LARGE**)



## 4. Updating the site

The `D_update_UCC_site.py` script applies the required changes to update the ucc.ar
site. It processes the **entire** UCC catalogue and searches for modifications that
need to be applied to update the site.

1. Generate/update per cluster `.md` (stored in `ucc/_clusters/`) and `.webp` files
   (stored in the `plots/` folders)
2. Update the main ucc site files. This includes the`ucc/_pages/DATABASE.md` as well as
   all the tables and images used in the site
3. Update JSON file (`ucc/assets/clusters.csv.gz`)
4. Move all files to their final destination
5. Check that the number of files is correct

### Input

- `data/df_UCC_B_updt.csv`: Used to access certain columns like Names and DB
- `data/df_UCC_C_updt.csv`: Primary source of data for most of the website content
- `zenodo/UCC_members.parquet`: Used for generating cluster plots
- `data/databases_info.json`: Latest UCC database JSON file

Several files are read to see if they need to be updated:
- `ucc/assets/clusters.csv.gz`: JSON file with the latest UCC data
- `ucc/_pages/XXXXX.md` (DATABASES, ARTICLES, TABLES)
- `ucc/_tables/XXXXX_table.md` (individual table pages)
- `ucc/_tables/dbs/{db_name}.csv` (one file for each original database in the UCC)
- `ucc/_clusters/{cluster_name}.md` (individual cluster pages)

### Output

- `data/df_UCC_C_updt.csv`: Updated `plot_used` column if modified
- `ucc/assets/clusters.csv.gz`: Updated
- `ucc/_pages/XXXXX.md`: Updated
- `ucc/_tables/XXXXX_table.md`: Updated
- `ucc/images/XXXXX.webp`: Updated
- `ucc/_tables/dbs/{db_name}.md`: Updated or generated
- `ucc/_clusters/{cluster_name}.md`: Updated or generated
- `UCC/plots/plots_X/*/*.webp`:  Updated or generated (CMD and Aladin plots)



## 5. Building the site

The Jekyll theme used by the site is a modified [Reverie](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/reverie) theme.

### 5.1 Local build

Before updating the live site, generate a local site build and check the results
**carefully**. To build a local copy of the site we use Jekyll, see [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

If this is a new installation, update the gems with:

```
$ bundle update --bundler
```

To build a local version of the site, position a terminal in the `/ucc` folder
(**not** the `/updt_ucc` folder) and run:

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental
```

This will generate a full version of the site locally which can take a while. For a
faster build, avoid processing the files in the `_clusters, _tables` folder (for
example, using a different `include` with fewer/different selected folders)


### 5.2 Live build

1. Push changes (if any) to each of the `plots/plots_*` repositories. To do this, position
the command line in the `UCC/plots/` folder and run:

```
$ cd UCC/plots/
$ for dir in plots_*/; do (cd "$dir" && [ -d .git ] && git acp "updt plots"); done
```

2. Create a 'New version' in the [Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8250523) 

  -a Make sure that the version number in the `zenodo/README.md` file matches that in
     the `_pages/CHANGELOG.md` file
  -b Upload the three files stored in the `zenodo/` folder:
     `README.md, UCC_cat.csv, UCC_members.parquet`
  -c Get a new DOI from Zenodo
  -d Add a _Publication date_ with the format: YYYY-MM-DD
  -e Use the same version number from the README (format: YYMMDD) in the release

Publish this new release and copy **its own url** (no the general repository url)

3. Update the `_pages/CHANGELOG.md` file, use the Zenodo URL for **this** release

4. **IMPORTANT**: Make sure that the `_config.yml` file includes all the folders

5. Push the changes to the `ucc` repository

6. Deploy the site using the Github workflow [Build GitHub Page](https://github.com/ucc23/ucc/actions/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml)
