Combined "ID" and "Name" columns.

There are two sets of two entries with repeated names in the UCC:

fof380, fof2326 --> ruprecht26
fof2223, fof2310 --> ascc77

To solve this I removed the fof2326 and fof2310 entries and added them as
secondary names to fof380 and fof2223


HE2022_1 ([A blind all-sky search...](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..262....7H/abstract))
mistakenly listed an entry as LP_2389 when in reality it is LP_2379 (checked with
the coordinates, PMs and plx in LIUPANG19). This is stored in the UCC and HE2022_1 as
FoF_2389. Renamed it to 'fof2379' in the UCC and HE2022_1; also renamed the associated
files


## 25061410

Found entries in the UCC with repeated names:

7117 7662 teutsch5
7554 7672 fsr0848
11581 11609 huluwa2
11581 11723 huluwa2
11609 11723 huluwa2

-teutsch5: this comes from Koposov (2008) assigning it as a secondary name for
Koposov 52. This is incorrect given the coordinates of Teutsch 5. I removed it
from KOPOSOV2008 and the list of names in Koposov 52 (i=7664)

-fsr0848: this also comes from Koposov (2008) assigning it as a secondary name for
Koposov 43. Removed it too from KOPOSOV2008 and the list of names in Koposov 43 (i=7556)

-huluwa2: this comes from QIN2023 where 'huluwa2' is assigned to three entries:
OCSN 197, OCSN 198, and OCSN 199. I removed the assiciation to 'huluwa2' from
OCSN 198 and OCSN 199, so that only OCSN 197 has it as a secondary name.


## 25061311

- Updated QIN2023 database, issue #49

Combined "RefName" and "Name" columns
Changed 'LP' in 2383, 2385, 2439, 2442 to 'FoF'
Changed ChaI(north), ChaI(south) to ChaI_north, ChaI_south

There are 223 OCs already in the literature classified as 2 and 3. The classification
is as follows:

1 =  f=0%, the new OCs in the OCSN catalog (101 entries, already in the UCC)
2 =  f<50% and most of the common members are located on the outer part of the cluster
in the OCSN catalog (25 entries)
3 =  f>50% or most of the common members are located in the center part of the cluster
in the OCSN catalog (198 entries)

(where f is "the fraction between the common member stars to members in the OCSN
catalog"). The issue with entries classified 2 and 3 is that they are often associated
with more than one OC (or mg):

OCSN 106 --> CWNU_375, CWNU_510, UPK_101

(there are 32 such entries) or even multiple times to the same OC already listed in
the UCC:

OCSN 176 --> CWNU_1136
OCSN 177 --> CWNU_1136
OCSN 178 --> CWNU_1136

OCSN 167 --> CWNU_1044
OCSN 168 --> CWNU_1044

To solve this I removed all the extra names for any entry with more than one other
name associated to it (e.g: "OCSN 106,CWNU_375,CWNU_510,UPK_101" becomes "OCSN 106");
which solves the first issue.

For the second issue, I removed the repeated name (CWNU_1136, CWNU_1044) so that these
become new entries.

These changes result in 59 new entries added to the UCC out of the 223 being added by
this DB updating process.

- Updated HE2022_1 database, issue #56


## 25061114

- Removed "dups_fnames_m,dups_probs_m" columns


## 25020409

- Added BORISSOVA2018


## 25020310

Changed 'vvvcc170' cluster name (and all files) to 'vvv170'. The 'vvvcc' denomination
comes from BICA19. There are 9 clusters that use this naming, including vvvcc170,
but this is the only one whose files also follow this naming. The files for the
remaining cluster follow the naming 'vvvXXX'.
I also modified in BICA19 and this version of the UCC all the 'VVV CC' to 'VVV-CL'.

Changed *all* names of 'vvv' clusters to follow the format 'vvv00X, vvv0XX, vvvXXX'.
This only affects 94 VVV clusters with numbers below 100.


## 25020212

- Changed 'vvvcl006' to 'vvv006' to match the rest of the VVV clusters:
