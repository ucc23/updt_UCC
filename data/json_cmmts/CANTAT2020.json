        "NGC 1252": "Long debated object; multiple studies disagree on its reality. Gaia DR2 and spectroscopic data show no coherent kinematic group. Currently considered an asterism or non-physical object. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 1520": "Flagged as non-existent in the Revised NGC; included in some catalogues with estimated parameters but generally considered a remnant or non-physical object. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 1557": "Not in WEBDA and classified as non-existent in early catalogues; later works list it as a cluster remnant with highly discrepant distance estimates. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 1641": "Originally associated with the LMC; later considered a Milky Way open cluster remnant. Sparse CMD and uncertain parameters; listed as a remnant in recent catalogues. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 1663": "Historically described as poor and irregular. Gaia DR2 data show large dispersion in proper motion and parallax, inconsistent with a physical cluster. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 1746": "Originally catalogued as a sparse cluster overlapping NGC 1750 and NGC 1758. Modern studies find no distinct third object; considered non-existent. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 1963": "Flagged as non-existent in the Revised NGC. No convincing photometric or kinematic evidence for a real cluster. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 2132": "Not studied in detail and classified as non-existent in early catalogues. Later catalogues list it as a possible remnant with uncertain parameters. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 2180": "Investigated multiple times as a dissolving cluster, but Gaia DR2 proper motions and parallaxes show no coherent group; confirmed as an asterism. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 2220": "Described as poor and scattered; flagged as non-existent in the Revised NGC. Included in some catalogues but generally regarded as a remnant candidate. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 2348": "Loose grouping marked as unverified or non-existent. Listed in catalogues with parameters but commonly classified as a cluster remnant. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 2394": "Flagged as non-existent in the Revised NGC. Sparse CMD-based estimates exist, but it is considered an asterism in recent compilations. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 3231": "Non-existent according to the Revised NGC. Gaia DR2 shows no coherent kinematic group; possibly a remnant or field fluctuation. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 4230": "Present in WEBDA without parameters. Distance estimates are highly discrepant; density profile compatible with random fluctuation. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 5269": "Marked non-existent historically; some Gaia-based work suggested a small co-moving group, but overall reality remains doubtful. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 5998": "Non-existent per Revised NGC. Catalogue distances vary widely; no clear observational confirmation. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 6169": "Listed in WEBDA but with no parameters. Multiple studies report inability to identify a real cluster. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 6481": "Flagged as non-existent. Proposed members show no coherent proper motion or parallax distribution in Gaia DR2. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 6525": "Historically non-existent. Large proper-motion dispersion and weak density enhancement suggest it is not a physical cluster. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 6554": "Marked non-existent; searched for unsuccessfully in several studies despite catalogue entries. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 6573": "Classified as non-existent in early catalogues. Large discrepancies in distance and age estimates; likely not physical. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 6588": "Non-existent in early catalogues; literature distances and ages are highly discrepant, reflecting uncertain nature. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 6994, Messier 73": "Extensively studied; modern astrometry and radial velocities conclusively show it is an asterism. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 7036": "Flagged as non-existent; Gaia DR2 data show no coherent kinematic group despite proposed members. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 7055": "Non-existent in early catalogues. Sparse and contradictory age and distance estimates exist. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 7084": "Marked non-existent. Proper-motion analysis confirms lack of a physical cluster. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 7127": "Poorly studied object with highly discrepant age and distance estimates; physical reality uncertain. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 7193": "Non-existent according to multiple studies. Gaia DR2 astrometry shows wide parallax spread inconsistent with a cluster. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 7772": "Compact grouping historically considered a remnant; Gaia DR2 and spectroscopy show no matching astrometric parameters, indicating an asterism. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 7801": "Long regarded as doubtful or non-existent. Included in some catalogues as a remnant, but evidence is weak. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "NGC 7826": "Classified as non-existent; Gaia DR2 and radial velocities confirm it is not a physical cluster. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "IC 1023": "Absent from several catalogues but listed as a remnant in others; limited evidence for a physical system. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "Ruprecht 3": "Appears as a tight group of bright stars, but Gaia DR1 and DR2 parallaxes and proper motions show it is an asterism. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "Ruprecht 46": "Density enhancement without meaningful CMD features; likely not a real cluster. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "Ruprecht 155": "Listed as a remnant in catalogues but never studied in detail; physical nature uncertain. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "Collinder 471": "Catalogue parameters are highly discrepant. No clear radius or kinematic signature identified. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "Basel 5": "Likely an asterism caused by patchy extinction in a dense field; Gaia DR2 astrometry is too dispersed for a real cluster. More details in Appendix A of the article.",
        "Loden 1": "Initially proposed as an old nearby cluster, but radial velocity studies show no co-moving group; not physical. More details in Appendix A of the article."
