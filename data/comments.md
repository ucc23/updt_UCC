# fof2379

Originally listed in [He et al. (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..262....7H/abstract) as 2389 from the
[Liu & Pang (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..245...32L/abstract) article. In reality, given its coordinates,  it is the 2379 entry
so it was renamed from 2389 to 2379 which resulted in the final name _FoF 2379_.
