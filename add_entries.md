# Add new entries

Adding new entries to the UCC that are not part of a new DB means that we are updating
_a DB that is already in the UCC_. For whatever reason this entries (or entry) was
left out initially and now we want to include it.

After updating the DB, the same steps used to [add_new_DB.md](add_new_DB.md) can be followed
using the name of the DB in `params.ini` (and its required column names)
